# Zombie Bears!
This repo contains my CS216 class project

## About
This is my largest coding project with numerous headers, C++ files, and a couple XML files as well. The makefile has not been tested so be wary of that if trying to use it to compile the project. The game begins and either loads a saved game from an xml file or begins a new game which then randomly generates 50 different dungeon levels and populates those levels at random with various items and creatures that are scaled in difficulty by the level. The player must descend as far as he dares into the dungeon before returning safely back to the surface, some creatures actively move towards the character but they're not very smart so they like to get caught in corners. If you need to take a break you can save the game and all the content will be dumped to an XML file for later reload and enjoyment.
